# Feature-Ranking

The file task_data.csv contains an example data set that has been artificially generated. The set consists of 400 samples where for each sample there are 10
different sensor readings available. The samples have been divided into two classes where the class label is either 1 or -1. The class labels define to what
particular class a particular sample belongs. 

The task is to rank the sensors according to their importance/predictive power with respect to the class labels of the samples. Your solution should be a
Python script or a Jupyter notebook file that generates a ranking of the sensors from the provided CSV file. The ranking should be in decreasing order where the
first sensor is the most important one.
